Art Jam Response

[Fragments of the Self](https://edmondpeng123.github.io/cart253/topics/art-jam/)

“Fragments of the Self” was incredibly inspiring, from the design to the code. It is a project that I find myself wanting to watch endlessly. The aesthetics of the greyscale, the geometric shapes, the photos being filtered every few seconds, and the way the shapes rotate, and eventually, align are all elements that are so eye-catching. Very visually pleasing, and that’s with only the human interaction of opening the link. When actually playing with the program, using the mouse to hover over each shape, the different outcomes make it so addictive to play with, especially when they align, making images invert, slow and increase or decrease in size all at the same time or my personal favourite, the blur effect. Not only a satisfying experience, but it’s also impressive in code as well, using trigonometry to determine the rotation of each shape. Knowing that the formulas for the rotation were some of the trickiest parts of this project, and seeing it pulled off, is also just as satisfying and inspiring, if not more so, than the visual elements of the project.

“Shy guy who is very shy!” is very interactive with its many moving parts; the use of glowing to indicate the interactive bits of the program, to the elements that cause the character to increase in happiness or increase in displeasure. There are many different features to change the character’s comfort level, with the use of clicking and dragging the curtain to hide the character, or clicking a light switch to turn the light off, or holding onto the character to make him red from embarrassment. Hearing about the difficulties, or tedious parts, such as the curved lines for the shy guy’s face, or the attempts at making the blush two ovals with feathered edges instead of the single rectangle, were aspects that, though they seem small and inconsequential, add such an immersion when playing with the program. Even when the idea doesn’t work out, whether it be because of the deadline, a change in the goal of the program, an element not working with other aspects of the code, or simply because it wasn’t the best idea, the attempts were important, if for nothing else than to try. Watching the progress of this program being made and tweaked was super insightful and motivating.

[The Pixelated Artist](https://seangregoryv8.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam)

“The Pixelated Artist” was so playful! The options of customization were so fun, and the sheer amount of options to switch up the avatar’s look was great for variety and added so much personality. Especially with different features having movement, such as blinking or pupils following the mouse, or a dizzy spell if the mouse moves in circles on the face. With the quantity of choice, looking at code was intimidating, with every facial feature being accounted for as pixels instead of using sprites/images. Especially considering there are a total of twenty-three different facial features for eyes, eyebrows and mouth, combined. Making each new response become the ‘base’ response, so that every time you toggled the feature, it wouldn’t change back to a default mouth/eye/eyebrow was also very clever. Lastly, the organization of his code was truly humbling.
