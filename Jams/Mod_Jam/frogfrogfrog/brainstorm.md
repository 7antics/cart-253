# Brainstorm Ideas

1.Make a "bad fly" to make the frog sick (by making the tongue slow down when eating a red fly)
2.Make the fly speed up or slow down
3.Letting the frog jump/ maybe lilypads
4.Certain flies make the frog have a power?
5.Making something else try to eat the flies
6.Obstacles
7.Add rain/storm elements
8.Add a timer or something to show/or track how hungry the frog gets
