Mod Jam Response

[You Look Fly! by Norah Wilcox](https://norahwilcox.github.io/CART253/topics/mod-jam/)

"You Look Fly!" had such a fun style; the game style leaned into that super stylistic, retro vibe with the old website tab from the early internet era. That old website framed the experience in a way that was so playful and nostalgic, along with the pixel art, which adds to the game's retro feel. The character design was charming and expressive with its simplicity, and the background art was beautifully detailed, which made the playthrough fun and immersive, and the art felt cohesive and thoughtful. From a gameplay perspective, discovering that the character’s tongue followed the position of the player’s most recent mouse click introduced an additional layer of strategy beyond the standard follow-and-click mechanics. I also appreciated the intentional use of a lerp function to create the delay in the tongue’s movement. Having struggled with implementing lerp for my own code, recognizing its effective use in her code significantly deepened my respect for the technical skill behind the game. Finally, the overall experience was wonderful, and her game was my favourite among all the ones I played.

[Astroid Shooter by Blaise Treverton](https://blaise2004.github.io/cart253/topics/AstroidShooterModJam/frogfrogfrog/)

“Astroid Shooter” is a classic asteroid game setup that relies on fast reaction time to keep up with the speed of the space rocks, which increases as the game continues. The background animation played a big role in the game’s difficulty; the constant motion in the background created a stronger sense of momentum and urgency, making it harder to visually track the passing asteroids as they also moved faster across the screen. With everything accelerating together, the screen felt busier, more chaotic, heightening my own panic while playing, even though the background didn’t directly affect any of the gameplay mechanics. Similarly, the background music also added to the intensity, making it just as high-tension and distracting as the star’s movement. Lastly, by taking a peek at his script, I noticed that he used two different star loops, one with larger ellipses and the other with smaller ellipses, so that he could create the depth of the starry sky and avoid the game having a flat 2-dimensional background. This could very easily be in an arcade game that I would rage-quit or lose all my coins in the process of trying to win!

[Fly Frog by Felix Dionne](https://gargamelleuwu.github.io/CART253/Mod%20Jam/template-p5-project/)

“Fly Frog” is well fleshed out; it has multiple mechanics that work in tandem, making the game feel unpredictable and challenging. The game features a hunger bar that slows the frog's tongue, spawns flies on different sides of the screen, which exhibit varying flight patterns. Some flies glide slowly across the screen, while others have different levels of speed and vertical movement. He also implemented a system that “punishes” missing the flies, making accuracy the main gameplay element, over the other Mod Jam games that use speed as a main game mechanic. It also feels very fun because of the bright/vibrant colours, the little animations of the moving water, the wings of the flies flapping, and last but not least, the customization. The customizable frogs add so much to my enjoyment of the game, even if it has no gameplay impact; nothing like being able to personalize my frog, yellow and blue-tongued, to make me dedicate more time because of my newfound attachment. Very real gameplay experience.
